# Sourcetoad Code - Part 1

I created one of these `README` files inside both directories. I just wanted to list out a few things in here rather than forgetting to mention it in the an email... So, if I do forget something I can just update it here and push it to the repo.

## Preface

Just wanted to cover a few things up front to help curb any confusion and/or head scratching. ;)

### Use of comment tags

As in Problem 1, I did leave a few comments prefixed with `NOTE:` to help explain a snippet of code or help explain my thought process.

### My Appreciation

    Hi Sourcetoad,
    
    I would like to thank Justin and anyone else on the Sourcetoad team who will be reviewing this repo. I just hope that my code examples are on par with your expectations. I know that time is important to us all so I appreciate your time and consideration.

    Regards,
    James Singletary
